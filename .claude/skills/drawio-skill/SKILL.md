# Draw.io Diagrams — XML Editor

## Overview

Generate and edit `.drawio` XML files on disk. **Editing only** — the user
opens the file in draw.io desktop, reviews the rendering, and gives feedback;
the skill applies targeted XML edits in response.

This skill **never**:
- runs the draw.io CLI,
- exports PNG / SVG / PDF / JPG,
- runs Python helper scripts,
- generates client-side viewer URLs.

## Bundled resources

Read on demand — none of these need to be in context up front.

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `references/diagram-types.md` | The user names a specific diagram type (ERD, UML class, sequence, architecture, ML/DL, flowchart) |
| `references/style-presets.md` | The user asks to learn / save / list / set-default / delete a style preset, or you've resolved an active preset and need the application rules |
| `references/style-extraction.md` | You're inside the Learn flow and need the extraction procedure (called from `style-presets.md`) |
| `references/troubleshooting.md` | A rendering looks wrong or the XML refuses to parse |

## Workflow

Before starting, assess whether the request is specific enough. If key details
are missing, ask 1–3 focused questions:

- **Diagram type** — which preset? (ERD, UML, Sequence, Architecture, ML/DL,
  Flowchart, or general)
- **Output location** — default is the user's working dir; honor any explicit
  path the user gives (e.g. "put it in `./artifacts/`"). Don't ask if they
  didn't mention one.
- **Scope/fidelity** — how many components? Any specific technologies or labels?

Skip clarification if the request already specifies these details or is
clearly simple (e.g., "draw a flowchart of X").

**Step 0 — Resolve active preset.** Determine which (if any) user-defined
style preset applies to this generation.

- Scan the user's message for a phrase that clearly names a style preset:
  "use my `<name>` style", "with my `<name>` style", "in `<name>` mode",
  "in the style of `<name>`". A bare `with <name>` does **not** count —
  "draw a diagram with redis" names a component, not a style. If a clear
  match is found → active preset = `<name>`.
- Else, check `~/.drawio-skill/styles/` for any file with `"default": true`.
  If found → active preset = that one.
- Else → no preset active; fall through to the built-in color/shape/edge
  conventions for the rest of the workflow.

Load the preset JSON from `~/.drawio-skill/styles/<name>.json`, falling back
to `<this-skill-dir>/styles/built-in/<name>.json`. If the named preset exists
in neither location, tell the user the name is unknown, list the available
presets (user dir + built-in), and stop — do **not** silently fall back to
defaults.

When a preset loads successfully, mention it in the first line of the reply:
*"Using preset `<name>` (confidence: `<level>`)."* See the
**Applying a preset** subsection of `references/style-presets.md` for how the
preset changes color/shape/edge/font decisions.

1. **Plan** — identify shapes, relationships, layout (LR or TB), group by
   tier/layer.
2. **Generate / edit** — write the `.drawio` XML file to disk. Default output
   dir is the user's working dir; if the user specified an output path or
   directory (e.g. `./artifacts/`, `docs/images/`), use that instead —
   `mkdir -p` the target dir first.
3. **Hand off for review** — report the absolute path of the saved
   `.drawio` file. The user opens it in draw.io desktop (or
   diagrams.net) and reviews.
4. **Review loop** — collect the user's feedback and apply targeted XML
   edits to the same file. Repeat until the user says approved / done / LGTM.

### Targeted edit rules

For each type of feedback, apply the minimal XML change:

| User request | XML edit action |
|--------------|----------------|
| Change color of X | Find `mxCell` by `value` matching X, update `fillColor`/`strokeColor` in `style` |
| Add a new node | Append a new `mxCell` vertex with next available `id`, position near related nodes |
| Remove a node | Delete the `mxCell` vertex and any edges with matching `source`/`target` |
| Move shape X | Update `x`/`y` in the `mxGeometry` of the matching `mxCell` |
| Resize shape X | Update `width`/`height` in the `mxGeometry` of the matching `mxCell` |
| Add arrow from A to B | Append a new `mxCell` edge with `source`/`target` matching A and B ids |
| Change label text | Update the `value` attribute of the matching `mxCell` |
| Change layout direction | **Full regeneration** — rebuild XML with new orientation |

**Rules:**
- For single-element changes: edit existing XML in place — preserves layout
  tuning from prior iterations.
- For layout-wide changes (e.g., swap LR↔TB, "start over"): regenerate full XML.
- Always edit the same `.drawio` file in place — do not create `v1`, `v2`,
  `v3` copies.
- **Safety valve:** after 5 iteration rounds, suggest the user open the
  `.drawio` file in draw.io desktop for fine-grained adjustments.

## Style Presets

A **style preset** is a named JSON file capturing a user's visual preferences
(palette, shapes, font, edges). When active, it fully replaces the built-in
color/shape conventions in this skill.

**Lookup order** when step 0 resolves a preset name:
1. `~/.drawio-skill/styles/<name>.json` — user presets (survive `git pull`)
2. `<this-skill-dir>/styles/built-in/<name>.json` — shipped built-ins
   (`default`, `corporate`, `handdrawn`)

Always lowercase the user-provided name before any file operation — the
schema enforces lowercase.

**For everything else — Learn flow (extracting a preset from a file),
management ops (list/default/delete/rename), application rules (color
lookup, shape keywords, edges, fonts, extras, interaction with diagram-type
presets), and validation — read `references/style-presets.md`.** It's only
needed when the user invokes those flows or when an active preset must be
applied to the current generation.

## Draw.io XML Structure

### File skeleton

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mxfile host="drawio" version="26.0.0">
  <diagram name="Page-1">
    <mxGraphModel>
      <root>
        <mxCell id="0" />
        <mxCell id="1" parent="0" />
        <!-- user shapes start at id="2" -->
      </root>
    </mxGraphModel>
  </diagram>
</mxfile>
```

**Rules:**
- `id="0"` and `id="1"` are required root cells — never omit them.
- User shapes start at `id="2"` and increment sequentially.
- All shapes have `parent="1"` (unless inside a container — then use the
  container's id).
- All text uses `html=1` in style for proper rendering.
- **Never use `--` inside XML comments** — it's illegal per the XML spec and
  causes parse errors.
- Escape special characters in attribute values: `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`,
  `&quot;`.
- **Multi-line text in labels:** use `&#xa;` for line breaks inside `value`
  attributes (not literal `\n`). Example: `value="Line 1&#xa;Line 2"`.

### Shape types (vertex)

| Style keyword | Use for |
|--------------|---------|
| `rounded=0` | plain rectangle (default) |
| `rounded=1` | rounded rectangle — services, modules |
| `ellipse;` | circles/ovals — start/end, databases |
| `rhombus;` | diamond — decision points |
| `shape=mxgraph.aws4.resourceIcon;` | AWS icons |
| `shape=cylinder3;` | cylinder — databases |
| `swimlane;` | group/container with title bar |

### Required properties

```xml
<!-- Rectangle / rounded box -->
<mxCell id="2" value="Label" style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;fillColor=#dae8fc;strokeColor=#6c8ebf;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="100" width="160" height="60" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>

<!-- Cylinder (database) -->
<mxCell id="3" value="DB" style="shape=cylinder3;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;fillColor=#f5f5f5;strokeColor=#666666;fontColor=#333333;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="350" y="100" width="120" height="80" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>

<!-- Diamond (decision) -->
<mxCell id="4" value="Check?" style="rhombus;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;fillColor=#fff2cc;strokeColor=#d6b656;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="220" width="160" height="80" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

### Containers and groups

For architecture diagrams with nested elements, use draw.io's parent-child
containment — do **not** just place shapes on top of larger shapes.

| Type | Style | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Group** (invisible) | `group;pointerEvents=0;` | No visual border needed, container has no connections |
| **Swimlane** (titled) | `swimlane;startSize=30;` | Container needs a visible title bar, or container itself has connections |
| **Custom container** | Add `container=1;pointerEvents=0;` to any shape | Any shape acting as a container without its own connections |

**Key rules:**
- Add `pointerEvents=0;` to container styles that should not capture
  connections between children.
- Children set `parent="containerId"` and use coordinates **relative to the
  container**.

```xml
<!-- Swimlane container -->
<mxCell id="svc1" value="User Service" style="swimlane;startSize=30;fillColor=#dae8fc;strokeColor=#6c8ebf;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="100" y="100" width="300" height="200" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
<!-- Child inside container — coordinates relative to parent -->
<mxCell id="api1" value="REST API" style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="svc1">
  <mxGeometry x="20" y="40" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
<mxCell id="db1" value="Database" style="shape=cylinder3;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="svc1">
  <mxGeometry x="160" y="40" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
</mxCell>
```

### Connector (edge)

**CRITICAL:** Every edge `mxCell` must contain a
`<mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />` child element. Self-closing edge
cells (`<mxCell ... edge="1" ... />`) are **invalid** and will not render.
Always use the expanded form.

```xml
<!-- Directed arrow — always include rounded, orthogonalLoop, jettySize for clean routing -->
<mxCell id="10" value="" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;" edge="1" parent="1" source="2" target="3">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>

<!-- Arrow with label + explicit entry/exit points to control direction -->
<mxCell id="11" value="HTTP/REST" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;exitX=0.5;exitY=1;exitDx=0;exitDy=0;entryX=0.5;entryY=0;entryDx=0;entryDy=0;" edge="1" parent="1" source="2" target="4">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>

<!-- Arrow with waypoints — use when edge must route around other shapes -->
<mxCell id="12" value="" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;" edge="1" parent="1" source="3" target="5">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry">
    <Array as="points">
      <mxPoint x="500" y="50" />
    </Array>
  </mxGeometry>
</mxCell>
```

**Edge style rules:**
- **Animated connectors:** add `flowAnimation=1;` to any edge style to show a
  moving dot animation along the arrow. Ideal for data-flow and pipeline
  diagrams. Example:
  `style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;flowAnimation=1;rounded=1;..."`
- **Always** include `rounded=1;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto` — these
  enable smart routing that avoids overlaps.
- Pin `exitX/exitY/entryX/entryY` on every edge when a node has 2+
  connections — distributes lines across the shape perimeter.
- Add `<Array as="points">` waypoints when an edge must detour around an
  intermediate shape.
- **Leave room for arrowheads:** the final straight segment between the last
  bend and the target shape must be ≥20px long. If too short, the arrowhead
  overlaps the bend and looks broken. Fix by increasing node spacing or
  adding explicit waypoints.

### Distributing connections on a shape

When multiple edges connect to the same shape, assign different entry/exit
points to prevent stacking:

| Position | exitX/entryX | exitY/entryY | Use when |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Top center | 0.5 | 0 | connecting to node above |
| Top-left | 0.25 | 0 | 2nd connection from top |
| Top-right | 0.75 | 0 | 3rd connection from top |
| Right center | 1 | 0.5 | connecting to node on right |
| Bottom center | 0.5 | 1 | connecting to node below |
| Left center | 0 | 0.5 | connecting to node on left |

**Rule:** if a shape has N connections on one side, space them evenly (e.g.,
3 connections on bottom → exitX = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75).

### Color palette (fillColor / strokeColor)

*Used only when no preset is active (see "Applying a preset" in
`references/style-presets.md`).*

| Color name | fillColor | strokeColor | Use for |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Blue | `#dae8fc` | `#6c8ebf` | services, clients |
| Green | `#d5e8d4` | `#82b366` | success, databases |
| Yellow | `#fff2cc` | `#d6b656` | queues, decisions |
| Orange | `#ffe6cc` | `#d79b00` | gateways, APIs |
| Red/Pink | `#f8cecc` | `#b85450` | errors, alerts |
| Grey | `#f5f5f5` | `#666666` | external/neutral |
| Purple | `#e1d5e7` | `#9673a6` | security, auth |

### Layout tips

**Spacing — scale with complexity:**

| Diagram complexity | Nodes | Horizontal gap | Vertical gap |
|-------------------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Simple | ≤5 | 200px | 150px |
| Medium | 6–10 | 280px | 200px |
| Complex | >10 | 350px | 250px |

**Routing corridors:** between shape rows/columns, leave an extra ~80px empty
corridor where edges can route without crossing shapes. Never place a shape
in a gap that edges need to traverse.

**Grid alignment:** snap all `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` values to
**multiples of 10** — this ensures shapes align cleanly on draw.io's default
grid and makes manual editing easier.

**General rules:**
- Plan a grid before assigning x/y coordinates — sketch node positions on
  paper/mentally first.
- Group related nodes in the same horizontal or vertical band.
- Use `swimlane` cells for logical grouping with visible borders.
- Place heavily-connected "hub" nodes centrally so edges radiate outward
  instead of crossing.
- To force straight vertical connections, pin entry/exit points explicitly
  on edges:
  `exitX=0.5;exitY=1;exitDx=0;exitDy=0;entryX=0.5;entryY=0;entryDx=0;entryDy=0`
- Always center-align a child node under its parent (same center x) to avoid
  diagonal routing.
- **Event bus pattern:** place Kafka/bus nodes in the **center of the service
  row**, not below — services on either side can reach it with short
  horizontal arrows (`exitX=1` left side, `exitX=0` right side), eliminating
  all line crossings.
- Horizontal connections (`exitX=1` or `exitX=0`) never cross vertical nodes
  in the same row; use them for peer-to-peer and publish connections.

**Avoiding edge-shape overlap:**
- Before finalizing coordinates, trace each edge path mentally — if it must
  cross an unrelated shape, either move the shape or add waypoints.
- For tree/hierarchical layouts: assign nodes to layers (rows), connect only
  between adjacent layers to minimize crossings.
- For star/hub layouts: place the hub center, satellites around it — edges
  stay short and radial.
- When an edge must span multiple rows/columns, route it along the outer
  corridor, not through the middle of the diagram.

## Common Mistakes

When something looks wrong (XML refuses to parse, layout broken, edges
misroute), see `references/troubleshooting.md` for a row-by-row mistake → fix
table.

## Diagram Type Presets

When the user requests a specific diagram type, read
`references/diagram-types.md` for the matching preset (shapes, edges, layout
direction). Pick by user phrasing:

| User says | Section in `references/diagram-types.md` |
|---|---|
| "ER diagram", "schema diagram", "data model" | ERD |
| "UML class diagram", "class diagram" | UML Class |
| "sequence diagram", "interaction diagram", "lifeline" | Sequence |
| "architecture", "system diagram", "service diagram" | Architecture |
| "neural network", "model architecture", "ML diagram", "deep learning" | ML / Deep Learning Model |
| "flowchart", "decision tree", "process flow" | Flowchart |

The diagram-type preset sets **structural** style keywords. If a user style
preset is also active (see `## Style Presets`), keep the structural keywords
and layer color/font/edge/extras on top — read `references/style-presets.md`
→ "Interaction with diagram-type presets" for the merge rules.
